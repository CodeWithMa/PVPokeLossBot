# PVPokeLossBot

## Summary

This project is a bot for the mobile game Pokemon Go, specifically for the PVP mode.
The bot uses computer vision to analyze screenshots of the game and make decisions on which actions to perform, such as sending "adb tap" commands to the game.
The bot also has a timer to forfeit the game after a certain amount of time has passed.

## The Secret to Farming Stardust in Pokemon Go: PVPokeLossBot's Elo Drop Strategy

"Elo" is a ranking system used in competitive games such as Pokemon Go PVP to match players of similar skill levels against each other.
By using PVPokeLossBot, the bot will forfeit the game on purpose, which will cause the user's Elo to drop lower and lower.
As a result, the user will only play against other players who also have a low Elo, most likely because they also use loss bot, thus the user will play against players who also forfeit the game, which can make it easier to farm stardust.
