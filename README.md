# PVPokeLossBot

This project is a bot for the mobile game Pokemon Go, specifically for the PVP mode.
The bot uses computer vision to analyze screenshots of the game and make decisions on which actions to perform, such as sending "adb tap" commands to the game.
The bot also has a timer to forfeit the game after a certain amount of time has passed.
